                Marwat Restaurant began with a small dream — to bring people together through the love of good food.
                From our very first recipe to our modern kitchen today, we’ve stayed true to our roots:
                fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and warm hospitality.
                Every dish we serve carries the spirit of tradition and the heart of home.
